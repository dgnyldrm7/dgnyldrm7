## 🌐 About Me

I’m driven by the challenge of transforming complex ideas into scalable and elegant software architectures.  
My journey in software development began in **2013**, and ever since, I’ve been focused on creating systems that are **reliable**, **extensible**, and **future-ready**.

I have a deep interest in **microservice architectures**, **cloud-native applications**, and **DevOps automation**.  
Building distributed systems with **RabbitMQ**, **Redis**, **Docker**, and **Azure DevOps** has been one of my favorite areas of expertise.

I believe great software is built on collaboration, clean architecture, and automation.  
Transparent communication and engineering discipline turn ideas into products that last.

When I’m not coding, I’m usually improving my CI/CD pipelines, exploring new technologies, or sharing architecture insights with the community.
